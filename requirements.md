# KalaFlow AI — Living Knowledge Intelligence Platform

## Problem
India has a vast amount of traditional knowledge and skills that are passed down orally but are not documented properly. As older generations retire, this knowledge is slowly disappearing. Younger generations also struggle to discover meaningful hobbies and real-world skills because learning resources are scattered and unstructured.

## Solution
KalaFlow AI is an AI-powered platform that captures knowledge from practitioners through video or audio recordings and converts it into structured learning modules. The platform automatically generates step-by-step guides, visual explanations, and multilingual content so anyone can learn traditional skills easily.
